Style Guide Evaluation
StatesMain.py - Aside from an initial comment stating the name of the file no comments. Indentation - tabs

LinkedList.py - Commented well with docstrings. Indentation - tabs. Classes inherit (object) if nothing else. Variable names good.


Code Evaluation
The code is displayed great. Very easy to read, not messy at all. Putting everything into your classes was nice and keeps StatesMain looking clean and short. Running, I received an indentation error at the end of the Node __init__ docstring. To fix it easily, I deleted the entire docstring, and it ran fine after.

Overall it's great.
