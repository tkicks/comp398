Style Guide Evaluation  
StatesMain.py - Aside from an initial comment stating the name of the file no comments. Indentation - tabs

LinkedList.py - Commented well with docstrings. Indentation - tabs. Classes inherit (object) if nothing else. Variable names are good.


Code Evaluation  
The code is displayed great. Very easy to read, not messy at all. In-line comments were used well when the code wasn't completel self-explanatory. Putting everything into your classes was nice and keeps StatesMain looking clean and short. Running, I received an indentation error at the end of the Node __init__ docstring. To fix it easily, I deleted the entire docstring, and it ran after. Output was a little difficult to read, and the search method is never used.

Overall it's great.
