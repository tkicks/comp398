Tools and Technologies
----------------------
* **Web Host**: We used Github Pages to host our website.
* **Custom Domain Name**: We obtained a free custom domain name through [Namescheap.com](https://nc.me/).
* **Front-End Framework**: We used the front-end HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript framework [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com).
* **Icons**: We utilized two icons ('X' close button and '<-' return button within the modal pop-ups) found on [flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com/) and designed the favicon using [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org).
* **GeoJSON Map**: We used [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to desing a map with specific markers.
* **Testing**: We used Python's Simple HTTP Server terminal command to run a local server to act as a testing environment during development.
* **Website Analytics** We used Google Analytics on our site to gather stats about the users.

* **Validating Robots.txt** We used the robots.txt checker provided by [Google's Webmaster Tools](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598?hl=en) to validate our robots.txt file.
* **Validating Sitemap** We also used [Google's Webmaster Tools](https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/4581190) to learn about constructing sitemaps and used the included examples to build our own.
