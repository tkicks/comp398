Homework 9  
==========  

This assignment provides a data visualization comparing the seats taken in Computer Science courses vs Mathematics courses in four different semesters. It will also say how many seats were taken when moused over a bar.  

#SVG Accessibility

##Source  
I began to scrape the data from a static copy of the course schedule created by copying and pasting the source code into a local file. I could only manage to gather the data that way by removing a fair amount of the actual page. After that point, I realized I'm not even sure how to put that data into an html file, or even access it. So I decided to take data by hand and put it into files. That took forever, so I narrowed it down to four semesters.
