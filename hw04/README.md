# Homework 4  

For this homework I have used *Python* to implement a basic [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to HTML converter. This converter can handle paragraphs, headers, block quotes, emphasis, lists, links, images, and code (see [Markdown Basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)).  

The code abides by the [Google Python style guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html). The program will prompt the user to enter a file name to convert.  

In this folder is:  

+ README Markdown file
+ Source for your Markdown converter
+ Source for your driver program
+ Sample input Markdown file that exhaustively demonstrates your converter
+ HTML output of running your driver program with the sample Markdown input
+ HTML output of running your driver program with the README input
